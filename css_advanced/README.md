# CSS Advanced Project

## Description
This project is the continuation of the **HTML Advanced project**.  
It focuses on applying **CSS styling** to a structured HTML page in order to replicate a design provided in Figma.  

We will implement advanced CSS concepts such as:
- Custom fonts (Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT)
- Responsive design with media queries
- Layout styling (header, banner, quotes, video section, membership, FAQ, and footer)
- Colors, typography, and positioning based on the Figma file

## Objectives
- Learn how to read and implement a design from Figma
- Practice CSS selectors, box model, and positioning
- Apply responsive design principles
- Use external stylesheets
- Reuse custom CSS variables

## Files
- `index.html` → Base HTML structure provided from the **HTML Advanced** project  
- `styles.css` → CSS file where all styles will be implemented
